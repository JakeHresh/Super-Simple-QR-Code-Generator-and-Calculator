# Super-Simple-QR-Code-Generator-and-Calculator

This is a super simple QR Code generator and calculator developed in Python.

With this tool, you can create QR Codes that encode numbers, which can be useful for storing item price information. Labels can also be added to QR Codes so that the generated image of the QR Code clearly indicates what the QR Code is for.

Additionally, if you have a QR Code scanner, you can scan QR Code information into the calculator fields that you add, allowing users to easily add up the numbers.

The system is very rudimentary, but is useful for anyone looking for a quick and easy solution for an inventory system for small business projects, like yard sales or lemonade stands.

The tool is built with Python using the following libraries:

qrcode

PIL
